# IPTV
Welcome to this simple project, I'll explain why I create it.

### Context
It’s 2020. The world has been terrified by COVID-19, people practice distancing social and even stay in home.
The consumer of tv and internet is high, the procastination is increasing.

### Problem
October 23, I’m been working until three days ago, now I’m on vacations for a few days. -I hope-
I live in a rent bedroom and the walls are wide, so cellular and television signals don’t get here. This situation wasn’t a problem before COVID-19 because I work so hard and only stay in the house to sleep. But now, with my current situation, I’m been trying stay away from pc and relax even I think watch television but it’s not possible because I live in a “cave” with wifi.

### Idea
Do exist a way to see tv channels in my smart tv using only wifi signal?
This is not a new or first idea in the world, acctualy I’m talk about [IPTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television).

### Solution
Let’s do it!

**... to be continue.**
