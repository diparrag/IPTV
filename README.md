# IPTV
Hello and welcome to this page. Let me explain why I create it!

### Context
It’s 2020. The world has been terrified by COVID-19, people practice distancing social and even stay in home. The consumer of tv and internet is high, the procastination time is incremently.

### Problem
October 23, I’m been working until three days ago… now I’m on vacations. I live in a rent bedroom and the walls are widthly, so cellular and television signals don’t get here. This situation wasn’t a problem before COVID-19 because I work so hard and only stay in the house to sleep. But now, with COVID-19 and vacations, I’m been trying stay away from pc and relax… even I think watch tv but it’s not possible because I live in a “cave” with wifi.

### Idea
So, what if I’ll found a way to see tv channels in my smart tv using wifi signal? This is not a new idea in the world, acctualy I’m talk about IPTV. Let’s work!
